## Personal projects

I am fond of software development, and I spend most of my time hacking on a
few personal projects:

  * [Dummy Meuporg](https://github.com/dummymeuporg) or sometimes called Dummy
  Project, is a toolsuite aimed for building an online 2D role playing game
  through an RPG Maker 2003 flavor. It is mostly written in C++, using Qt
  for the map editor, SFML for the client and Boost for the server part. I am
  also using lua to script some Map evenements and NPC behaviour. **A game
  built on top of Dummy Meuporg is being developed with two soulmates of
  mine, so please check out this page frequently**.
  * [Cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-discord) is a Discord bot written
  in python which very first aim was to genereate random sentence to amuse
  people. It can be plugged in many ways though, yet the API is not clearly
  fixed at the moment.
  * [Anagrams](https://ge0-anagram.herokuapp.com/) is a web interface where you
  can find the anagrames of your first & last name. The database only contains
  surnames and first names of people born in France though, so you might feel
  very limited if you are looking for specific names.
