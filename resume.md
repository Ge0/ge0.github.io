## Professional experiences

Software Engineer

Oct 2019 – Now: Chief Technical Officer at **42 Hexagons**

**42 Hexagons** is a software editor located in Massachusetts, United States.

As the CTO and the co-founder, I am in charge of:

  * defining the whole development process;
  * architecturing and designing our different pieces of software;
  * planning releases with different deadlines;
  * providing customer support.

*I have to fill out my resume here. Quite lazy at the moment.*


## Personal projects

I am fond of software development, and I spend most of my time hacking on a
few personal projects:

  * [Dummy Meuporg](https://github.com/dummymeuporg) or sometimes called Dummy
  Project, is a toolsuite aimed for building an online 2D role playing game
  through an RPG Maker 2003 flavor. It is mostly written in C++, using Qt
  for the map editor, SFML for the client and Boost for the server part. I am
  also using lua to script some Map evenements and NPC behaviour. **A game **
  **built on top of Dummy Meuporg is being developed with two soulmates of **
  **mine, so please check out this page frequently**.
  * [Cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-discord) is a Discord bot written
  in python which very first aim was to genereate random sentence to amuse
  people. It can be plugged in many ways though, yet the API is not clearly
  fixed at the moment.
  * [Anagrams](https://ge0-anagram.herokuapp.com/) is a web interface where you
  can find the anagrames of your first & last name. The database only contains
  surnames and first names of people born in France though, so you might feel
  very limited if you are looking for specific names.
