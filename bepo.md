## Maths

The math symbols are often written from the first keystroke `altgr + d`, then:

**Standard set of numbers**

- `+ b + R` => ℝ
- `+ b + Q` => ℚ
- `+ b + C` => ∁
- `+ b + Z` => ℤ

For some reason, I cannot make the N with `+ b + N`.


## Laz

- `alt gr` + `r`, g => ğ.
- `alt gr` + `s`, z => ʒ.
- `alt gr` + `s` + `v`, z => ǯ.
- `alt gr` + `v`, k => ǩ.

Otherwise, for ejective sounds, append the usual letter with an ’.
