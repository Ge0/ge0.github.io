# Profesional projects

Too much.

# Personal projects

I am fond of software development, and I spend most of my time hacking on a
few personal projects:

## [Dummy Meuporg](https://github.com/dummymeuporg)

Sometimes called Dummy Project, is a toolsuite aimed for building an online 2D
role playing game through an RPG Maker 2003 flavor. It is mostly written in
C++, using Qt for the map editor, SFML for the client and Boost for the server
part. I am also using lua to script some Map evenements and NPC behaviour.

I do not have the time to work on the project anymore but I have left its source code for conveniency. If you want some (French) feedback about it, you might want to check out this [/2020/02/22/dummy-mon-meilleur-echec.html](blog post).

If you wonder about the project's name, well, check this out (French spoken):

## [KoyOkulum](https://www.koyokulum.org)

As I love both Turks and Turkey, upon meeting a good comrade of mine whose
name is Levent, we had the idea of building a crowd-funding website to
gather funds in order to help village schools ("köy okulları"), mostly in
need of decent supplies to renew their school or even dress their pupils
with decent schoes!

The website is made with Django and Boostsrap/JQuery. It took a few months
to be released. We have made an independent association under the law of
1901 to manage the development of the platform among other things.

Last but not least, KoyOkulum's right spelling is "Köy Okulum" and stands
for "My village school".

## [Anagrams](https://ge0-anagram.herokuapp.com/)

**Anagrams** is a web interface where you
can find the anagrames of your first & last name. The database only contains
surnames and first names of people born in France though, so you might feel
very limited if you are looking for specific names.

Oh, and it's open source.
