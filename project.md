# Personal projects

I am fond of software development, and I spend most of my time hacking on a
few personal projects:

## [Dummy Meuporg](https://github.com/dummymeuporg)

![Dummy Meuporg](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38380910?s=200&v=4)

Sometimes called Dummy Project, is a toolsuite aimed for building an online 2D
role playing game through an RPG Maker 2003 flavor. It is mostly written in
C++, using Qt for the map editor, SFML for the client and Boost for the server
part. I am also using lua to script some Map evenements and NPCÂ behaviour.
**A game built on top of Dummy Meuporg is being developed with two soulmates of
mine, so please check out this page frequently**.

If you wonder about the project's name, well, check this out (French spoken):

## [Cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-discord)

**Cacophony** is a Discord bot written in python which very first aim was to
genereate random sentence to amuse people. It can be plugged in many ways
though, yet the API is not clearly fixed at the moment.


## [Anagrams](https://ge0-anagram.herokuapp.com/)

**Anagrams** is a web interface where you
can find the anagrames of your first & last name. The database only contains
surnames and first names of people born in France though, so you might feel
very limited if you are looking for specific names.
