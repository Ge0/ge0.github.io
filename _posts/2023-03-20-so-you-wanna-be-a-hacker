As usual, it has been quite a while (well, in fact, just a few months) since I last wrote anything on this blog. Sometimes I feel the urge of writing something, producing some actual content not to feel unproductive (especially when I am getting lost into my numerous projects, similar to mountains that I might not climb up to the top).

Anyway!

Recently, I have met a young guy who got quickly fascinated by **cybersecurity** as a whole.
Still in 2023, I find this term to be quite *bullshit* and I would always say
**Network Security**, **IT security**, **System security** (Why not?) or sometimes **Penetration testing**.

As a matter, of fact, I was really interested in this field for a few years, until I switched to proper software development, because I love building things, especially in a creative process.

But let’s not diverge from the point. In the title, I mentioned this precise term: “hacker”. At the time I heard about this word first, it was all about people who were building things, in an original way. It was all about people who also were able to deconstruct (and *not* destroy) a system, just for the sake of understanding how a mechanism works. Mostly this had something to do with software, but it can be some physical object.

If you have ever heard of the term “hacker”, there are significant chances that you have heard it from mainstream medias, where it is all about people who are breaking into systems. They “hack into” things, etc. most of the time in an illegal way.
