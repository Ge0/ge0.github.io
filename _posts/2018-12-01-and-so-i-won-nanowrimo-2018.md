title: "And So I Won NaNoWriMo 2018!"
---

Every year, the [NaNoWriMo](!https://nanowrimo.org), which stands for *National
Novel Writing Month* takes place from November 1^st^, 12.00 am, to November
30^rd^, 11.59 pm. This annual challenge consists in writing a novel with a
minimum of 50,000 words within the mentioned period, using both the language
and the theme of our own choice.

How about the reward? Just the pleasure of having participated and having
reached such a goal while abiding by the established rules. They are indeed
people called “nano rebels” who, for instance, would start writing before
November 1^st^. Others would start over an already started draft. Although
cheating is technically permitted, it is at the discretion of the challengers
but, in the end, people should really them oneself:

> I wrote a full novel of 50,000 words within a month by respecting the rules.

In this post, I will tell you about my novel project, how the writing went and
how I consider the future.

# I am attracted to Japan

Among the people who know me quite well, the fact that I like Japan and its
culture is not a secret. Nothing suprising, since we are quite a lot to
love this country.

With this comes a taste for writing (maybe because I love programming?),
another taste for martial arts (being a computer guy made de think about doing
something for both my body and my mind) and a taste for history (being a
programmer turns people into curious ones, I think).

This led me to getting intested in a period in Japan that is called
*Bakumatsu* 「幕末」. Basically this ideogram means “end of goverment within
the tent”, where “tent” here refers to the military one, the pavilion. We are
talking about the end of a military dictatorship.

From 1853 to 1869, Japan went through a period of doubts, rebellions,
skirmishes that led to the abdication of the military governor, also known as
the *shōgun* 「将軍」. The power was given away to the Emperor, who just got
a symbolic power (not political) since.

As regards little stories within this period, I was seized with emotion (I
still am) when I found out that there was a group of young *rōnin* 「浪人」 —
samurais without lord — who stood with the *shōgun* so they would protect him
until the very end, as true samurais despite they hadn’t the title, while
abyding by, thanks to a remarkable rectitude, the chivalry code that the
japanese warriors were meant to respect: the *bushidō* 「武士道」. This group
is called the *shinsengumi* 新選組」.

One of its proeminent members is called *Hijikata Toshizō* 土方歳三」. He was
the vice-commander of this group. On his (french) wikipedia page, I read such
an excerpt:

> Dans un post-scriptum intéressant à propos de son implication dans la guerre
du Boshin, l’officier français Jules Brunet fait l’éloge du vice-commandant
Hijikata. Louant sa capacité de leader, il indique que s’il avait été en
Europe, il aurait certainement été promu général.
Source: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijikata\_Toshiz%C5%8D

Basically we can translate this into:

> In an interesting post-scriptum about his involvement into the Boshin War,
the french officer Jules Brunet praised the vice-commander Hijikata. Lauding
his leader skills, he mentionned that if he went in Europe, he would certainly
be promoted as a general.

A french officer who acknowleged the merit of a Japanese. How beautiful it is!

Meanwhile I have learnt that Jules Brunet inspired the main character of the
movie *The Last Samurai* and that Napoleon III sent Frenches to Japan in order
to teach samurai to occidental warfare.

French people. To Japan. Who went with samurais.

I *had* to explore all of that. After a couple of journeys into Japan and
some bibliographic search. The more I discovered, the more I was seduced by
what I was learning.

I was nevertheless upset enough. Brunet was more famous in Japan than he was
in France, in addition of being known thanks to a movie which barely inspired
our beloved french officer. Although he did not make as “great” things as
Jeanne d’Arc or De Gaulle did, I still told myself: what if I gave him some
credit my way?

Now you know more about my attraction to Japan. Why did I want to write a
novel?
