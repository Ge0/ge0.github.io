title: "And So I Won NaNoWriMo 2018!"
---

Every year, the [NaNoWriMo](!https://nanowrimo.org), which stands for *National
Novel Writing Month* takes place from November 1^st^, 12.00 am, to November
30^rd^, 11.59 pm. This annual challenge consists in writing a novel with a
minimum of 50,000 words within the mentioned period, using both the language
and the theme of our own choice.

How about the reward? Just the pleasure of having participated and having
reached such a goal while abiding by the established rules. They are indeed
people called “nano rebels” who, for instance, would start writing before
November 1^st^. Others would start over an already started draft. Although
cheating is technically permitted, it is at the discretion of the challengers
but, in the end, people should really them oneself:

> I wrote a full novel of 50,000 words within a month by respecting the rules.

In this post, I will tell you about my novel project, how the writing went and
how I consider the future.

# I am attracted to Japan

Among the people who know me quite well, the fact that I like Japan and its
culture is not a secret. Nothing suprising, since we are quite a lot to
love this country.

With this comes a taste for writing (maybe because I love programming?),
another taste for martial arts (being a computer guy made de think about doing
something for both my body and my mind) and a taste for history (being a
programmer turns people into curious ones, I think).

This led me to getting intested in a period in Japan that is called
*Bakumatsu* 「幕末」. Basically this ideogram means “end of goverment within
the tent”, where “tent” here refers to the military one, the pavilion. We are
talking about the end of a military dictatorship.

From 1853 to 1869, Japan went through a period of doubts, rebellions,
skirmishes that led to the abdication of the military governor, also known as
the *shōgun* 「将軍」. The power was given away to the Emperor, who just got
a symbolic power (not political) since.

As regards little stories within this period, I was seized with emotion (I
still am) when I found out that there was a group of young *rōnin* 「浪人」 —
samurais without lord — who stood with the *shōgun* so they would protect him
until the very end, as true samurais despite they hadn’t the title, while
abyding by, thanks to a remarkable rectitude, the chivalry code that the
japanese warriors were meant to respect: the *bushidō* 「武士道」. This group
is called the *shinsengumi* 新選組」.

One of its proeminent members is called *Hijikata Toshizō* 土方歳三」. He was
the vice-commander of this group. On his (french) wikipedia page, I read such
an excerpt:

> Dans un post-scriptum intéressant à propos de son implication dans la guerre
du Boshin, l’officier français Jules Brunet fait l’éloge du vice-commandant
Hijikata. Louant sa capacité de leader, il indique que s’il avait été en
Europe, il aurait certainement été promu général.
Source: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijikata\_Toshiz%C5%8D

Basically we can translate this into:

> In an interesting post-scriptum about his involvement into the Boshin War,
the french officer Jules Brunet praised the vice-commander Hijikata. Lauding
his leader skills, he mentionned that if he went in Europe, he would certainly
be promoted as a general.

A french officer who acknowleged the merit of a Japanese. How beautiful it is!

Meanwhile I have learnt that Jules Brunet inspired the main character of the
movie *The Last Samurai* and that Napoleon III sent Frenches to Japan in order
to teach samurai to occidental warfare.

French people. To Japan. Who went with samurais.

I *had* to explore all of that. After a couple of journeys into Japan and
some bibliographic search. The more I discovered, the more I was seduced by
what I was learning.

I was nevertheless upset enough. Brunet was more famous in Japan than he was
in France, in addition of being known thanks to a movie which barely inspired
our beloved french officer. Although he did not make as “great” things as
Jeanne d’Arc or De Gaulle did, I still told myself: what if I gave him some
credit my way?

Now you know more about my attraction to Japan. Why did I want to write a
novel?

# “Art is the only thing that grants immortality.”

Writing a novel? ouch! Such a pain in the butt!

Firstly because it is a long-winded project. Secondly because, knowing me quite
well, I never stay very long on the same project. I quickly get bored. It is
a shortcoming of mines that I find it difficult to fix, despite my will to do
so.

Writing a novel, it possibly means leaving a mark of our journey on Earth, into
the little History; into the french national library’s collection. It means 
resisting against the preset order, against the global righteousness that makes
us think we’re not capable, against the codes, the shame, the received opinion.
It means resisting against the conclusion that we should stay into our routine
already set.

Writing consists in feeding one’s mind. Like painting, playing music. It
consists in expressing what we have deep in us through artistical detours of
any kind.

Us people enjoy writing blog posts, a lot of technical stuff or a simple
answer on forums. This does not look like a piece of work for sure, because we
are passionate about what we do. This means a lot to me and probably to you.

Since it is hard for me to keep up with a lasting project, in addition of
enjoying writing… I made a decision. I *had* to set out to write a novel. If
other mates did it, why wouldn’t I, after all?

The NaNoWriMo was the appropriate time.

# Getting started

So I was thinking something like: “I need do improve the France image and I
want do romance a friendship between Jules Brunet the french officer and
Hijikata Toshizō, notorious member of the *shinsengumi*.”

The History does not say much about their interactions. To be honests, it is
very brief about what Brunet did in there. So I could take advantage of those
areas of shadow.

During my research, I learnt that a French named Christian Polak had made some
ineffable work on documenting relations between Frenches and Japaneses, as much
as commercial ones than military ones.

As a matter of fact, did you know that a silk road existed between Lyon and
Yokogama? Canuts needed japanese silkworms. Those were immune to some diseases
the french ones were vulnerable to. If today Lyon is the capital of silk, well,
it is thanks to Japan!

In a nutshell, the very first source of information I dug into was the *Soie et
Lumières* book, from Christian Polak. I had to pay a visit to the french
National Library for that.

*Figure*

It this book, I learnt about the guidelines on how went the first french
mission in Japan. I had a plan for my novel.

The source who helped me the most was nothing but *L’engagement des officiers
français dans la fin du shogunat et la restauration de Meiji (1867–1869)* from
Emmanuel Faubry. It consists of a more complete resource. This author made a
quite amazing bibliography indeed, Christian Polak’s book included.

In France, the *Defence Historical Service*, whose short name is SHD for
*Service Historique de la Défense*, contains military archive from the
different army corps. In his ebook, Mr Faubry gave many references, folder
numbers from the SHD which contain themselves a huge amount of handwritten
mails from French people at the time in Japan.

See how the folder looks like:

*Figure*

This board contains at least 150 years old handwritten notes, letters and
reports. This is insane!

I wish I showed pictures of the letters, but I need a formal authorization from
the SHD. Which I haven’t… I must say that these brave people demand a regular
mail rather than an electronic one. Thus being said, I am not disappointed at
all by the fact I physically went to the *Château de Vincennes* so I could
visit the place.

I just had to review a few details as regard my novel: characters, scenes where
they play, the main progress of my story, etc.

I spent the whole October month doing so, deliberately keeping myself away from
hacking on a personal project. I did believe in this writing project!
